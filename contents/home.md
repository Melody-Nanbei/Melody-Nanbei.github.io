She is an undergraduate student majoring in Russian Studies at the School of Foreign Studies, Nanjing University. With a strong academic record, I ranked first in my department and was awarded the National Scholarship. Beyond my academic focus, I have actively engaged in interdisciplinary projects, serving as the principal investigator of a national innovation training program, where I combined linguistic analysis with broader cultural studies. I have also taken on various leadership roles, including serving in the University Youth League Committee and leading volunteer initiatives with over 350 service hours. My goal is to bridge humanities and global perspectives through critical thinking and practical engagement.
